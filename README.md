## Description
The Car Dealership Management System is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage a dealership's vehicle inventory. This includes adding, removing, and viewing vehicles, as well as searching for vehicles based on criteria like price range, make/model, year, color, mileage, vehicle type, and VIN. The project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for dealership employees to manage inventory efficiently, utilizing object-oriented principles and Java enums for enhanced organization.

## Features
<ul>
<li>Add a Vehicle: Allows users to add a new vehicle to the dealership inventory by entering details such as VIN, make, model, year, vehicle type, color, mileage, and price.
<li>Remove a Vehicle: Users can remove a vehicle from the inventory by entering the VIN.
<li> View All Vehicles: Displays a list of all vehicles in the dealershipâ€™s inventory.
<li> Search Vehicles by Various Criteria:
  <ul> 
<li>Price Range </li>
<li>Make/Model </li>
<li>Year Range </li>
<li>Color </li>
<li>Mileage Range </li>
<li>Vehicle Type (Car, Truck, SUV, Convertible)</li>
<li>VIN </li>
  </ul>
<li> Vehicle Type Descriptions: Each vehicle type has a unique ASCII art display and description, shown when adding a vehicle or viewing details in the inventory.

</ul>

## How It Works
1. Initialization: The application loads an initial inventory from a CSV file using DealershipFileManager. This inventory can then be modified during the session.
2. User Interaction: A menu-driven interface allows users to interact with the system. The user selects options from the menu, and the system performs the corresponding actions.
3. File Management: Inventory data can be loaded from and saved to a CSV file, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
4. Vehicle Management:
<ul>
<ul>
  <li>Vehicles are stored in an ArrayList within the Dealership class.</li>
  <li>Vehicle information, including type, is handled using an enum (VehicleType), which provides ASCII art and descriptions.

</ul>
</ul>



------------------
